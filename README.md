# About NamMD

NamMD is a project forked from [SlideWithGitHubPages](https://github.com/yamap55/SlideWithGitHubPages).

NamMD uses [github\-markdown\-css](https://github.com/sindresorhus/github-markdown-css) and modules listed in [docs/licenses.txt](docs/licenses.txt).

The name of NamMD means 'Nam (南無 or Namo) Markdown' and 'Not Any More Mandalas (曼荼羅)'.
Both nam and mandara are Buddhist terms.
Nam means 'taking refuge in' or 'becomming a believer of'.
Mandalas are a picture that illustrates the world of Buddhism, and in Japan, it is also a slang word for too dense and complicated figures in slides.
I hope that NamMD will be helpful in making simple slides by using Markdown.
